# ETE v.4 Gallery

A demostration of some of the capabilities of ETE v.4.

## Status

For the moment it only includes examples of how to set the NodeStyle
(when doing `TreeLayout(ns=...)`).

In the future we intend to add examples of how to set the TreeStyle
too.


## Issues

The following examples have some known issues:

- `ete4_attrface.py` - Seems to not add any face.
- `ete4_htmlface.py` - The face appears and disappears immediately.
- `ete4_outline.py` - Once the outline appears, it never disappears.
- `ete4_legend.py` - If you download as svg/pdf a tree with layout
      with legends, the legends do not appear in the downloaded image.
